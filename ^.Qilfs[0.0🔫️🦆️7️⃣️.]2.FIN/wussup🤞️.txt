right ,

(fixing this may even fix "all problems'
then u wuld just rename ur fx + w/e wasn't right w/e

❔️im guessing the problem is "FULLSUM"?
as long as this inodes past 32 were good... ❔️

❕️also "highlighting/selecting" is turned of in editor...
not good 4 copy pasting problems...❕️

of problem ,better 2 fix this [2] tho than the otherone[3]

📆️4.15.24}switches 2 new inode just fine , but doesn't use the new file? 
(i didn't factor out just replaced code..., cuz things are
a bit diff.
👨🏽‍🚀️
i may refactor just 2 make it Write 2 file (heavy violence and trolling right now may send all 2 bed tho)*and would still be on track whnever u have 2 send them 2 bed👨🏽‍🚀️
📮️its not NEEDING a refactor, the formula went negative...
it writes when it goes back pos...📮️👩🏻‍🏭️
i will fix w/e is wrong with the negative. and compare that 2 
header_FX...👩🏻‍🏭️
*were just gonna use header. and pull it out the "loop"
then pass "i" or var from "qilo"

2.can it load "INTO quilo?" also...
1.(as well as just replacing the old in quilo with this new one
📆️4.14.24}
getting there, just make sure reading it is ez. so we can reuse it . ur really on the right track...

*its making 2 blocks for some reason and obv using the second one...duh? 
(writes first 2 2nd but then the rest 2 3rd...
📆️4.13.24}
no longer crashes , but is making new inode instead of storing , imo. 
(was 2 diff problems , ez fix tbh, lets go)
📮️seems like its actually writing after the "buffers limits" 
instead of moving 2 front of new inode...
(can we exit after inode is made or w/e first💡️ ;) ? 
 📮️
📆️4.12.24 =
📮️that is helpful. i thnk theres all kindsa of malformation going on 
once the new inode was supposed 2 be made

(things are being made in main, and i think it made a "NEW INODE"
(instead of putting in the old one ... um no... )
📮️
👨🏽‍🚀️i would just run like 5 mallocs of diff sizes at diff places and see wut happens ;)👨🏽‍🚀️
🧿️ofc we can allocate by [#]but u will have 2 figure out "strsize()" urself w/e;
w/e its not the end of the world is the point , the codebase is small and modular
and this happened...it is wut it is feels messed up but the program was gonna fail so w/e🧿️

🤓️i dont even think its the "system(exes)" cuz they've neever been a problem 
so it may not be that bad :/ (u could probably diagnose by swapping one of hte earlier mallocs and leaveing the later one ;) (>as opposed 2 using "GDB/GHIDRA LMFAO") ;
ps dont use that "all free()" thats just a distraction and its gone <3z🔍️🤓️
👨🏾‍🏫️if worse comes 2 worse, just dont use malloc. evertime i replace malloc with 
# the code works till next malloc. (or go backwards and see which "corrupted"
 w/e its not magic👨🏾‍🏫️
 📦️i wanted 2 allocate in a seperate function like i did for the 
 "program files(they never corrupted...)
 i think its header mallocs that "keep using or w/e same "memory /namespace"
 make it corrupt ez. i dont think we actually ran into this b4 therefore and its a 
 new problem. 
 but it doesn't explain why inodes worked at some point(not provable!<but not anymore...)🏚️w/e they will work after this, they obv werent gonna work ....🏠️ 📦️

we have "ascii fd 2 binary fd" now.

now that "binary fd" needs 2 go into inode

(and we need 2 make sure its a diff inode than the one that '2.qi.lngn]🖌️🦾️]0000'
is about  2make <3

do 2 "inode" in same fx <or  there is no way 2 pass "FILENAME" which we watn now! + hash? w/e>

(can drop .bin into a "user[]/TEMP/" dir *if u want ) u dont actually NEED it .(but the whole point of doing this was 2 examien files, tho u should build in 2 examine entire inode and DUMP "THAT" instead ;) <3 )

On Linux, UTF-8 is the 'native' encoding for all strings, and is the format accepted by system routines like fopen()

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/112216/which-terminal-encodings-are-default-on-linux-and-which-are-most-common






🧝‍♂️️
just go with "UTF-8" for now unless it doesn't work

(this is the "best it does..."

👋️🌍️would be nice 2 convert hello world 2 "binary"
convert it back 2 "utf-8" and it actually run.
